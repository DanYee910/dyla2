Design Doc - Dyla 2

story:
- viral zombie outbreak in “SF”, a phony all-natural cure gains a wide following and efforts to contain the spread are failing through sheer ignorance.  by the time the scope is realized, social order has broken down and the outbreak is out of control.
- because of panic, cutoff of power, supplies, water, food, electricity, most people flee the city
- remainder succumb and die
- the city is cutoff from all sides and isolated, anyone inside left to their fate
- anyone attempting to escape the city through the 10 mile killzone will be shot on sight, and the seas are patrolled.  at this point escape is not an option
- you have taken shelter on an “island” in the middle of the urban park (“stow lake of golden gate park”)
- because it is isolated you have escaped unnoticed, and you have barricaded or destroyed the small bridges connecting you to the rest of the city.
- you have located a couple of small barges and boats to enable you to travel across the water and reach the city.
- you are now out of food and must venture into the city.
- your main objective is to survive and prepare for the coming winter, when you will have little hope of moving around and scavenging supplies.
- you lead a camp of about 5 people.  2 people must be left behind to tend to camp needs, the remaining 3 most venture out and obtain much needed supplies to keep everyone going.

Card types:
1. Event cards - revealed at the start of each turn, represent random occurrences that happen, can be good or bad.

2. Location cards - represent different locations throughout the city, with different dangers and rewards.  All locations have 3 choices for the player:
  - smash and grab - takes 1 action, do not fight, reveal all cards and take 1 random item if any revealed.
  - quick search - takes 2 actions, fight reduced threat, take all item cards
  - full search - take 3 actions, fight full threat, take all item cards and bonus items from top of item deck

3. Item cards - represent things you find from searching locations.  Can be as simple as food or materials to add to camp totals, or more powerful items for the party, camp, tools, etc…  Item variety will correspond to location, items found in the suburbs will be different from items found downtown for example.

4. Zombie cards - Zombies, have a single number, you must have enough attack to beat the number or they send you scurrying back to camp with no loot for the turn.
